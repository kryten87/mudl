Link Handling Test
===============================================================================

Open this file in mudl to test link behavior. Each section contains clickable
links that should behave as described.


## Anchor links

These should scroll within the document without opening anything external.

- [Jump to bottom of this document](#bottom)
- [Back to top](#link-handling-test)
- [Go to external URLs section](#external-urls)


## Local markdown files

These should open in a new mudl window (or focus the window if already open).

- [Stub file - same directory](./Resources/stub.md)
- [This file (should focus current window)](./link-handling.md)
- [Project plan - parent directory](../Plans/2026-02-mudl-app.md)


## External URLs

These should open in your default web browser.

- [Example.com](https://example.com)
- [GitHub](https://github.com)
- [Apple](https://apple.com)


## Email links

These should open in your default mail client.

- [Send test email](mailto:test@example.com)
- [Email with subject](mailto:test@example.com?subject=Test%20from%20mudl)


## Other local files

These should open in the default app for that file type (not in mudl).

If you have these files in the same directory, they'll work:

- [Text file](./Resources/example.txt) — opens in your default text editor
  via `xdg-open`
- [PDF file](./Resources/example.pdf) — opens in your default PDF viewer via
  `xdg-open`
